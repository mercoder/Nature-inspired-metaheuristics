## Implement Nature-Inspired Metaheuristics to optimize NP-Hard 0/1 Knapsack Problem

### BAT ALGORITHM
The Bat Algorithm is a nature inspired algorithm which was developed by Xin-She Yang in 2010. It is based on the hunting behavior of bats at night. Bats use echolocation to detect prey, avoid obstacles and locate their resting location. These bats emit high-pitched sounds and interpret their echoes to determine the distance and direction of targets. Each bat has a frequency (f), position (x), velocity (v), loudness (A) and pulse rate (r).


### 0/1 KNAPSACK PROBLEM 
0/1 Knapsack Problem or Binary Knapsack Problem is a NP-Hard combinatorial problem that aims to maximize profits from a knapsack without exceeding its maximum capacity. Items of different price and weight will have to be selected to be put in the knapsack while maintaining a weight that doesnâ€™t exceed a constant and at the same time obtain the maximum possible total price.
